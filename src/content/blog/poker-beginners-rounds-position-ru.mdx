  - "Texas Hold'em is not about getting lucky cards; it is a game of incomplete information where you pay to see the next piece of the puzzle."
  - "Position (where you sit relative to the dealer button) is the single most important concept in poker. Acting last is a massive mathematical advantage."
  - "The most common beginner mistake isn't playing hands badly - it's choosing to play far too many weak hands before the flop."

Most beginners approach Texas Hold'em like it's a game of luck: you get dealt two cards, you hope you hit a pair, and you bet some chips. 

The sharks at the table love this. They know that poker is actually a game of information and positioning. If you sit down at an online cash game and you don't understand the strict rhythm of the betting rounds or the monumental importance of table position, you are playing blindfolded.

Here is the cynical, no-nonsense crash course on how a real hand of Texas Hold'em actually flows, and why where you sit matters more than the cards you hold.

## The Rhythm: The Four Betting Rounds

In Texas Hold'em, every player is dealt two private "hole cards". Over the course of the hand, five public "community cards" will be dealt face-up in the middle of the table. You use your two cards and the five community cards to make the best possible 5-card poker hand. 

But you don't get to see all the cards at once. You have to pay for them across four distinct betting rounds. 

<StepNode step="1" title="Pre-Flop (The Filter)">
You look at your two private cards. No community cards have been dealt yet. Based entirely on the strength of those two starting cards, you must decide whether to 'Call' the mandatory blind bets, 'Raise' the bet, or 'Fold' and wait for the next hand. *Most of your money will be saved here by simply folding.*
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="2" title="The Flop (The Big Reveal)">
The dealer places the first three community cards face up. You now know 5 of your 7 total cards. A second round of betting begins. If you missed the flop completely (e.g., your highest card is a 10 and the board is Ace-King-Jack), you should almost certainly fold to any bet.

<StepNode step="3" title="The Turn (The Tension)">
One more community card is laid out. The bets usually get much larger here because hands are becoming polarized - players either have a strong made hand, a strong draw, or nothing at all. 
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="4" title="The River (The Final Price)">
The fifth and final community card is revealed. The final betting round occurs. If someone bets out, you have to decide if your completed hand is strong enough to pay the final price to go to 'Showdown' (where players flip their cards and the best hand wins the pot).
</StepNode>

## The Hidden Weapon: Position

If you only learn one concept from this guide, learn this: **Position is everything.**

Position refers to where you are sitting relative to the "Dealer Button" (which moves one seat to the left after every hand). Your position dictates what order you have to act in during the betting rounds.

<MythBuster myth="It doesn't matter when I act, because the strength of my cards doesn't change based on where I'm sitting." reality="THE INFORMATION ADVANTAGE">
Poker is a game of incomplete information. If you are the first person who has to bet (Early Position), you have no idea what the six people acting after you are going to do. If you have a weak pair and you bet $10, someone behind you might raise you to $50, forcing you to fold and waste your $10. 
If you are the last person to act (Late Position / The Button), you get to see exactly what every other player did before you have to make a decision. If three people before you aggressively raised the pot, you can safely fold your weak pair for free. Information is power, and acting last gives you all of it.

## The Three Rules of Survival

If you are a beginner sitting down for your first cash game session, stick to these three strict rules to avoid depleteing chips immediately:

1. **Fold Your Junk Pre-Flop:** The biggest mistake beginners make is wanting to "see the flop" with garbage hands like Jack-4 or 8-5. You should be folding roughly 75% of your hands before the flop even happens.
2. **Play Tighter in Early Position:** Because you don't have information, only play premium hands (like Ace-King or Pocket Pairs) when you are one of the first to act.
3. **Never Fall in Love with One Pair:** Hitting a pair of Aces on the flop feels great. But if there are three other people still in the hand by the River, and the betting gets heavy, one pair is rarely going to be the winning hand.

<ProTip title="THE CURIOSITY TAX" icon="🛑">
Never "Call" a large bet on the River just because you are curious to see if the other player is bluffing. Curiosity is the most expensive emotion in poker. If you have a weak hand and facing a large bet, statistically, the other player actually has the goods. Fold, conserve your chips, and wait for a hand where you hold the advantage.
