Poker gives you just enough feedback to make you dangerously confident. You remember the one time your gut feeling was right, you completely block out the ninety times it drained your stack, and suddenly, you think you've cracked the code.

The reality? Most amateur players lose chips not because they don't know the rules, but because they believe in gambling folklore instead of math. 

Here is exactly how to stop playing like a victim of variance and start playing like someone who understands the machine.

## The "Rigged" Delusion

Let's address the most expensive excuse in the game right away.

<MythBuster myth="Online poker is rigged to create 'action flops' so the site can collect more rake." reality="THE MATH CHECK">
Online poker isn't rigged; you are just playing too fast. A live casino dealer handles about 25-30 hands per hour. Online, you might see 100 hands an hour (or 400 if you multi-table). Because you are seeing 10x the volume, you are going to see 10x the amount of "impossible" bad beats and statistically improbable run-outs. It's not a conspiracy; it's just accelerated probability. 
</MythBuster>

If your first instinct after losing a pot is to blame the software, you are ignoring the actual mistakes you made three betting rounds ago.

## The Aggression Misstep

You've watched the World Series of Poker on television. You see professionals make massive, soul-crushing bluffs with absolute garbage cards. You assume that to win, you need to be the table bully.

<StepNode step="1" title="Aggression Requires a Story">
When a pro bluffs, they are telling a detailed story based on how they played the entire hand. When an amateur bluffs, they are just blindly throwing chips hoping the other guy gets scared.
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="2" title="Don't Bluff Calling Stations">
You cannot bluff a bad player. If the guy to your left has called every single bet for the last hour with bottom pair, *do not try to bluff him*. He doesn't know enough to fold. You only beat bad players by betting when you actually have the goods.
</StepNode>

## The 'Sunk Cost' Fallacy

One of the fastest ways to empty a poker account is saying the phrase: *"Well, I've already put so much in the pot... I have to call."*

No, you don't. 

<ProTip title="THE POT DOES NOT BELONG TO YOU">
Once you put chips into the pot, they are gone. They are not yours anymore. If someone goes all-in on the river and you know you are beaten, folding is not "giving up" your money. Calling with a losing hand because you feel committed is mathematically identical to just throwing cash into a fire. Protect your remaining stack.
</ProTip>

## "I Just Know My Card Is Coming"

Poker is a game of incomplete information. Amateurs try to *guess* what the next card will be. Winning players *calculate* if it is profitable to pay to see the next card.

If you have four hearts and need a fifth to make a flush on the river, the math is static. You have roughly a 20% chance of hitting it. 

*   If the pot is $100 and it costs you $10 to call, the math says you should call. 
*   If the pot is $100 and it costs you $80 to call, the math says you must fold. 

It does not matter if you "feel" it coming. If you pay $80 to try and win $100 on a 20% chance, you will eventually go broke. 

## The Boring Truth About Winning

The most profitable poker players at the low stakes aren't the guys pulling off wild bluffs. They are the players who sit there folding for forty minutes straight, watching the table get impatient, and then extracting maximum value when they finally pick up pocket Kings.

If you want to stop losing money:
1.  **Fold More:** You should be folding 70-80% of your starting hands before the flop.
2.  **Respect Position:** A mediocre hand (like Queen-Jack) is garbage if you have to act first, but powerful if you get to act last.
3.  **Shut Down on Tilt:** If you lose a big pot and immediately feel your heart rate spike and a desperate urge to win the money back *right now*, close the laptop. You are no longer playing poker; you are just punting.
