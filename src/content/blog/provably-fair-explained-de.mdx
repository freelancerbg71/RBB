takeaways:
  - "Provably Fair is a cryptographic system that allows you to mathematically verify that the casino did not alter the result of a game after you placed your bet."
  - "The system uses a 'Server Seed' (hidden by the casino) and a 'Client Seed' (controlled by you) to generate the outcome."
  - "Provably Fair proves the RNG is untouched. It does NOT mean the house edge is zero, and it does NOT guarantee the casino will actually pay you your winnings."

If you play Crash, Dice, or Mines on any crypto-focused casino, you will see a little shield icon in the corner of the screen labeled **"Provably Fair"**. 

Casinos use this phrase constantly in their marketing. They want you to believe that because the game is Provably Fair, the casino is fundamentally safer, more trustworthy, and more profitable than a traditional online casino. 

This is half true. Provably Fair is a brilliant piece of cryptographic transparency. It completely stops the casino from "rigging" the RNG (Random Number Generator) against you. But it does absolutely nothing to protect you from the true structural risks of gambling. Here is how the system actually works.

## The Problem With Traditional Casinos

In a traditional online casino, you click "Spin" on a slot machine. A server sitting in a data center in Malta generates a random number and tells your screen you lost. You have no way of knowing if that number was genuinely random, or if the server was specifically programmed to make you lose because you were on a winning streak. You simply have to trust the casino's regulators (like the UKGC or MGA) to audit the code.

Provably Fair eliminates the need for trust. It turns the game's RNG into an open mathematical receipt.

## How the Cryptography Works

Think of Provably Fair like a sealed envelope. You and the casino are going to agree on the outcome of a dice roll before it happens.

<StepNode step="1" title="The Server Seed (The Casino's Half)">
Before the round starts, the casino's server generates a random string of numbers and letters called the **Server Seed**. They do not show this to you (because if you knew it, you could predict the outcome). Instead, they show you a cryptographic *Hash* of the seed. This is the sealed envelope. The casino is committing to their half of the math before you bet, and they cannot change it later.
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="2" title="The Client Seed (Your Half)">
Your browser generates its own random string, called the **Client Seed**. *You* have total control over this. You can literally delete the random string and type "LUCKYDOG99" if you want to. Because you control half of the mathematical equation, the casino cannot possibly predict the final outcome to rig it against you.
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="3" title="The Nonce and The Verification">
When you hit 'Bet', the game takes the Casino's Server Seed, your Client Seed, and a **Nonce** (a basic counter that goes up by 1 every round), smashes them together, and runs them through an algorithm to determine the result (e.g., the plane crashes at 2.40x). 
</StepNode>

Because the casino committed their Server Seed up front via the Hash, you can use a third-party calculator after the round ends to input the raw data. The math will verify with 100% certainty that the casino did not alter their numbers after you chose your bet. 

<MythBuster myth="Because the game is Provably Fair and I can verify every hand, the casino cannot possibly manipulate the outcome." reality="THE LOGIC CHECK">
Provably Fair only proves that the *math of the specific spin* was random. It does absolutely nothing to protect you when you try to withdraw your money. The casino cannot rig the dice, but they can still lock your account, demand infinite KYC documents, or simply refuse to process your Bitcoin withdrawal. A fair shuffle doesn't matter if the dealer refuses to let you leave the building with your own chips.
</MythBuster>

<ProTip title="ROTATE YOUR SEEDS" icon="🔄">
If you are playing a Provably Fair game heavily, get into the habit of clicking the "Provably Fair Settings" button and rotating your Client Seed every few dozen rounds. This forces the casino to reveal their old Server Seed, allowing you to mathematically verify that your previous session was completely fair. It takes five seconds and keeps the operator honest.
</ProTip>

Provably Fair is a fantastic piece of consumer protection technology. But remember: The math is perfectly random, but the underlying game still has a House Edge. You are playing a mathematically fair game that is explicitly designed to favor the house over time.
