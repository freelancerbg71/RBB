takeaways:
  - "Wagering requirements (playthrough) act as a lock on your deposit. You cannot withdraw a single cent until you bet thousands of dollars."
  - "The headline multiplier (e.g., '30x') is deceptive. You must check if it applies to just the Bonus, or the Deposit + Bonus."
  - "Game weightings and max-bet limits exist to ensure you grind out your requirement on high-variance slots rather than low-edge table games."

You see a banner ad flashing: **"Deposit $100, Get $100 FREE!"** 

You deposit your money, play a few hands of Blackjack, win $50, and hit the withdraw button. A message pops up saying your withdrawal is denied because you haven't met the "playthrough requirements." After reviewing the terms, you find a requirement to place $6,000 in wagers before the initial $100 becomes eligible for withdrawal.

Welcome to the reality of casino bonuses. 

A bonus is a contractual agreement that keeps your funds in play over an extended period, requiring you to navigate the mathematical house edge over thousands of hands or spins. Here is how to translate the fine print.

## What "30x Wagering" Actually Means

A wagering requirement (also called 'playthrough' or 'rollover') dictates exactly how much collective money you must pass through the casino's machines before your cash is "unlocked." 

But the multiplier isn't the catch. The catch is *what* the multiplier applies to. 

<StepNode step="1" title="The 'Bonus Only' Setup">
You deposit $100 and get a $100 bonus, with a 30x requirement on the **Bonus amount**. 
You must place $3,000 in bets ($100 x 30). This is somewhat standard.
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="2" title="The 'Deposit + Bonus' Structure">
You deposit $100 and get a $100 bonus, with a 30x requirement on the **Deposit AND Bonus**. 
You now must place **$6,000** in bets ($200 x 30). This essentially turns a 30x requirement into a 60x requirement.
</StepNode>

<MythBuster myth="I'll just claim the bonus and play safe bets on Roulette until I clear the 30x requirement." reality="THE GAME WEIGHTING REALITY">
This is structurally accounted for. Checking the "Game Contributions" section of the Terms and Conditions. Slots usually contribute 100% to your wagering requirement. However, low-house-edge table games like Blackjack and Roulette usually contribute 10% or even 0%. If Roulette contributes 10%, a $10 spin only clears $1 of your requirement. It is mathematically nearly impossible to clear a bonus on table games.

## The "Max Bet" Handcuffs

You realize you have to wager $6,000 to unlock your funds. You decide to just do twelve $500 spins on a slot machine to get it over with quickly. 

Attempting this typically violates the bonus terms, resulting in the forfeiture of both the bonus and any associated winnings.

Buried in the Terms and Conditions of almost every bonus is a "Max Bet" clause. It usually dictates that while a bonus is active, you cannot place a single bet larger than $5.00. 

This requires you to execute 1,200 individual spins, significantly increasing your exposure to the slot machine's RTP (Return to Player) over an extended session. 

## The Win Cap

Some casinos go a step further. They will give you the bonus, attach a massive wagering requirement, and *then* stipulate a "Maximum Cashout" rule. 

This means even if you manage to hit a $5,000 jackpot while grinding through your $5 wager limits, you might hit a clause that says "Maximum withdrawal from bonus funds is capped at $500." Any amount exceeding that cap is automatically forfeited upon withdrawal, limiting the true upside of the promotion.

<ProTip title="THE ULTIMATE STRATEGY" icon="🛑">
For 90% of players, the smartest move regarding casino bonuses is to gently click the 'Opt Out' button. Playing with raw cash (no bonus attached) means you can play whatever game you want, at whatever stake size you want, and withdraw your winnings exactly ten seconds after hitting a jackpot. Peace of mind is usually worth more than the appeal of matched funds.
</ProTip>

If you insist on taking a bonus, never accept anything with a rollover higher than 35x on the *bonus amount only*, and immediately check if there is a win cap. If such a cap exists, consider weighing whether the bonus provides true value for your style of play.
