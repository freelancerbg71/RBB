takeaways:
  - "Craps is two games happening at once: a low-edge grind on the perimeter, and a high-tax lottery in the center."
  - "The 'Pass Line' and 'Don't Pass' bets are the only reasons to be at the table. Everything else is mostly noise."
  - "Taking 'True Odds' behind your Pass Line bet is literally the only wager in the entire casino with a zero percent house edge."

Craps is arguably the most intimidating game in the casino. The table looks like the control panel of a nuclear submarine, there are four dealers yelling at each other, and the players look like they're speaking a different language.

The casino wants it to look complicated. Complexity masks bad math. 

When you strip away the shouting and the fifty different places you can put your chips, Craps is actually a remarkably simple two-phase game offering some of the best - and absolute worst - odds on the floor. 

Here is how to play your first session without getting taken for a ride.

## The Two Phases of Craps (The Only Mechanics You Need)

You don't need to understand every number on the board. You just need to understand the rhythm of the game. Every round of Craps operates in two distinct phases:

<StepNode step="1" title="The Come-Out Roll (Phase 1)">
This is the opening roll. Look at the plastic puck on the table. If it says **"OFF"**, you are in the Come-Out phase. The shooter rolls the dice.
*   If they roll a **7 or 11**, Pass Line bets win instantly.
*   If they roll a **2, 3, or 12**, Pass Line bets lose instantly.
*   If they roll *any other number* (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10), that number becomes "The Point," and the game shifts to Phase 2.
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="2" title="The Point Phase (Phase 2)">
The dealer flips the puck to **"ON"** and places it on the number that was just rolled. Now, the game completely changes. The shooter will roll the dice repeatedly until one of two things happens:
*   They roll **The Point** again (Pass Line wins).
*   They roll a **7** (Pass Line loses, and the round is over).
</StepNode>

That's the entire game. Everything else on the table is just a side bet on what happens between those rolls.

## The Only Bets You Should Make

You can play Craps for thirty years and never touch 80% of the felt. Here is where the smart money goes.

### 1. The Pass Line
This is the fundamental bet of Craps. You place it *before* the Come-Out roll. You are betting that the shooter will either win on the first roll, or establish a Point and hit it again before rolling a 7. The house edge is a tiny **1.41%**.

### 2. The Don't Pass Line
The literal opposite of the Pass Line. You are betting *against* the shooter (hoping they roll a 2 or 3 on the Come-Out, or a 7 before the point). The house edge is actually slightly better here (**1.36%**). 

<ProTip title="THE 'DARK SIDE' ETIQUETTE">
Betting the Don't Pass line is mathematically sound, but in a live casino, you are betting that everyone else at the table will lose. If you play "the dark side," do it quietly. No one likes the guy cheering when the table goes bust. (If you're playing online, nobody cares).
</ProTip>

### 3. Taking "True Odds"
Once a point is established, the casino allows you to place a second bet directly behind your Pass Line bet. This is called "Taking Odds." 

**This is the single most important bet in gambling.** Why? Because the casino pays this bet out at *true mathematical odds*. There is **0.00% house edge** on this wager. 

Always bet the table minimum on the Pass Line, and put as much money as your bankroll allows behind it in True Odds.

## The Bets with the Highest House Edge

Look at the center of the Craps table. You'll see boxes for "Hardways", "Any Craps", "Any 7", and "Horn Bets." 

Stay away from them. 

These are called Proposition (Prop) Bets, and they are designed for gamblers who are bored and want high-variance action. The payouts sound amazing (30:1 for a Hard 12!), but the house edges are catastrophic.

<MythBuster myth="Throwing a chip on 'Any 7' is a smart hedge to protect your Pass Line bet." reality="THE MATH CHECK">
The 'Any 7' bet pays 4:1 if the next roll is a 7. People use it to 'insure' their main bets. But the house edge on this specific wager is a steep **16.67%**. You are buying insurance from a mobster. Let your main bets ride and accept the variance.
</MythBuster>

## The "Tourist" Survival Plan

If you are walking up to a table (or opening a live dealer stream) for the first time, follow this exact script to avoid depleteing cash:

1.  Wait for the puck to say **OFF**.
2.  Put $10 on the **Pass Line**.
3.  When a Point is established (the puck flips to **ON**), put $10 or $20 directly behind your Pass Line bet as **Odds**.
4.  Stand there with your hands in your pockets until the round is over.
5.  Repeat.

Craps is loud, chaotic, and aggressively marketed toward impulse decisions. If you stick to the perimeter of the board and abuse the zero-edge Odds bet, you are playing one of the smartest games in the house.
