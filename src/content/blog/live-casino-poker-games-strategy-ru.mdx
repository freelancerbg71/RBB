  - "Live Casino Poker is not Texas Hold'em. You cannot bluff the dealer, and there are no psychological reads. The game is purely mathematical."
  - "The 'Pair Plus' side bets in Three Card Poker are massive revenue drivers for the casino. They carry house edges up to 7%."
  - "The mathematically correct strategy for Three Card Poker is robotic: Play Q-6-4 or higher, and fold absolutely everything else."

When you open the "Live Poker" lobby at an online casino, you aren't walking into a smoky backroom to face off against nine other sharks in Texas Hold'em. 

You are sitting down to play games like **Three Card Poker**, **Caribbean Stud**, and **Casino Hold'em** against a paid casino employee. 

<MythBuster myth="I am a very good Texas Hold'em player, so I will naturally dominate these live casino dealer games." reality="THE SKILL CHECK">
Your poker face is useless here. You cannot bluff the algorithm. You cannot pressure the dealer into folding. The dealer is forced by the rules to play every single hand in a predetermined way. These are not games of psychology; they are games of hard, fixed mathematics, exactly like Blackjack or Baccarat. 
</MythBuster>

If you play these games based on "gut feeling" or standard poker intuition, you will lose your money incredibly fast. Here is how to actually survive the three most common variants.

## Three Card Poker (The Q-6-4 Rule)

Three Card Poker is notoriously steep on players who don't understand the math, largely because the hand rankings are different (a Straight is harder to make than a Flush in a 3-card deck, so a Straight pays out more).

The entire game boils down to a single decision: Do you fold, or do you double your bet to 'Play' your hand against the dealer?

<StepNode step="1" title="The Golden Rule">
The absolute, mathematically proven optimal strategy for Three Card Poker is entirely robotic: **You 'Play' any hand that is Queen-6-4 or higher. You fold absolutely everything else.**
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="2" title="Why Q-6-4?">
To 'Qualify' (meaning the dealer's hand actually pays you out), the dealer must hold at least a Queen High. If you hold Q-6-4, the math dictates that playing the hand saves you more money over the long term than folding and surrendering your Ante.

## Caribbean Stud Poker (The AK Rule)

In Caribbean Stud, you get five cards and the dealer gets five cards, but you only get to see *one* of the dealer's cards before you have to decide to fold or double your bet.

<ProTip title="THE CARIBBEAN STUD DECISION MATRIX" icon="♠️">
The basic strategy here is incredibly strict:
1. **Always Raise** if you hold any Pair or better.
2. **Always Fold** if your hand is weaker than an Ace-King high.
3. If you hold exactly Ace-King high, you look at the dealer's upcard. Only raise if the dealer's card matches one of your cards, or if the dealer is showing a 2 through Queen and you hold a Jack or Queen. 
</ProTip>

## The "Side Bet" Misconception

The true reason casinos relentlessly promote Live Dealer Poker games is the Side Bets. 

You will see tempting circles on the digital felt labeled **"Pair Plus"**, **"6-Card Bonus"**, or **"Progressive Jackpot"**.

These side bets promise massive payouts (like 100:1 for a Royal Flush). They also mathematically destroy your bankroll. The house edge on a standard Three Card Poker Ante bet is a reasonable ~3.3%. The house edge on the Pair Plus side bet is often over **7.2%**. The house edge on the 6-Card Bonus can be over **10%**.

The casino is intentionally using your knowledge of standard poker hand rarities to trick you into placing mathematically catastrophic prop bets. 

If you want to play these games responsibly, ignore the shiny side bets completely, memorize the baseline strategy, and accept that you are playing a house game, not a skill game.
