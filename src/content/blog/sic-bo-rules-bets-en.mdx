takeaways:
  - "Sic Bo is simply a game of betting on the outcome of three dice. The board looks complex because it lists every mathematical possibility."
  - "The Small/Big bets are the only wagers you should be making. They carry a very low house edge of 2.78%."
  - "The flashy bets in the middle of the board (like specific Triples) carry a devastating house edge that can exceed 18%. Avoid them entirely."

Walk past an Asian casino floor (or its online live dealer equivalent), and you will see Sic Bo tables packed with people shouting at a glass dome holding three bouncing dice. 

Look at the betting felt. It is terrifying. It looks like a complex algebraic chart covered in Chinese characters, glowing numbers, and dozens of different betting squares. It makes Craps look simple.

It is an illusion. **Sic Bo is incredibly simple.** 

The dealer rolls three dice. You bet on what the total will be, or what specific numbers will show up. That's it. Here is the completely unauthorized guide on how to strip away the noise and play the game without getting hustled.

## The Only Bets You Need to Know

The casino intentionally clutters the board with dozens of terrible bets to distract you from the two *good* bets. Focus your eyes on the top corners of the board.

<StepNode step="1" title="The 'Small' Bet">
You are betting that the total sum of the three dice will be between **4 and 10**. 
It pays 1:1. The house edge is a very respectable **2.78%**. 
*The Catch:* If the dice roll a Triple (e.g., three 2s or three 3s), the 'Small' bet automatically loses.
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="2" title="The 'Big' Bet">
You are betting that the total sum of the three dice will be between **11 and 17**. 
It pays 1:1. The house edge is also **2.78%**. 
*The Catch:* Same as above. If the dice roll a Triple (e.g., three 4s or three 5s), the 'Big' bet automatically loses. This rule is exactly how the casino secures its mathematical advantage.

If you play nothing but Small and Big, Sic Bo operates very much like playing Red/Black on a European Roulette wheel. You will tread water, have fun, and maybe catch a decent streak.

## The Bets Designed to Drain You

The middle of the Sic Bo board is where bankrolls go to die. The casino lights up these sections with massive payout numbers to tempt you into making terrible mathematical decisions.

### Specific Totals
You can bet that the dice will add up to exactly a specific number (like 9 or 15). The payouts look appealing (often 6:1 or 14:1 depending on the rarity of the total). However, the house edge on these bets usually hovers around **7% to 11%**. It's a bad bet. 

### The Triples (The Ultimate Trap)
The most prominent part of the board asks you to bet that a specific Triple will land (e.g., three 4s). 

It pays an incredible **150 to 1** (or 180 to 1 at some tables). 

<MythBuster myth="I'm up $100, so sprinkling a few chips on a Specific Triple is a fun, low-risk way to try and hit a massive payout." reality="THE MATH CHECK">
The true mathematical probability of rolling a specific triple (like three 4s) is exactly 1 in 216. The casino is paying you 150 to 1 for an event that happens 216 to 1. The resulting house edge is a catastrophic **16.2%** (or worse, depending on the payout table). It is one of the worst bets in the entire casino. You are practically handing the dealer your chips.

## The "Live" Sic Bo Variants

If you play online, you will likely encounter games like "Super Sic Bo" or "Mega Sic Bo". 

In these variants, random multipliers (up to 1,000x) drop onto random betting squares after the bets are closed. It looks like a massive upgrade for the player.

<ProTip title="THE MULTIPLIER TAX" icon="🛑">
To fund those massive random multipliers, the live game developers severely reduce the base payouts for all the standard bets. If you bet on a specific total and it hits *without* a multiplier, you are paid significantly less than you would be at a standard, boring Sic Bo table. They are increasing the volatility of the game dramatically. Only play the "Super" variants if your bankroll can handle extreme dry spells.
</ProTip>

Sic Bo is a fantastic game if you stick to Small/Big. The moment you start chasing the 150:1 Triples in the middle of the board, you stop playing a table game and start buying lottery tickets.
