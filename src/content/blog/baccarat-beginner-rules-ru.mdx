takeaways:
  - "You are not choosing actions like in blackjack. You are betting on which predetermined cinematic sequence finishes closer to 9."
  - "Banker and Player bets offer some of the lowest house edges in the casino. The Tie bet is a tax on people who like long odds."
  - "The third-card rule looks like ancient algebra, but you don't need to know it. The dealer does the math for you."

Walk past the high-roller baccarat tables in any major casino and you'll see players dramatically bending cards, keeping meticulous charts on scorecards, and agonizing over every hand. It looks intimidating. It looks like a game of intense skill and mathematical foresight.

It isn't.

Baccarat is arguably the simplest game on the casino floor. It is essentially an elegant coin flip where you get to pick heads or tails, and the house takes a small cut for flipping the coin. That's it. If you can count to 9, you can play baccarat.

## The 60-Second Setup

<StepNode step="1" title="Pick a Side">
You are not playing *against* the dealer. You are betting on an outcome. You place chips on "Banker", "Player", or "Tie". (Ignore the names; "Player" doesn't mean you, and "Banker" doesn't mean the house. They are just the two sides of the coin).
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="2" title="The Deal">
The dealer deals two cards to the Player side, and two cards to the Banker side.
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="3" title="The Score">
The hands are added up. The side closest to a total of 9 wins.
</StepNode>

## Card Values (The Only Math You Need)

In baccarat, you can never bust. The highest possible score is exactly 9.

- **Aces** count as 1.
- **Numbers 2-9** count as face value.
- **Face Cards (J, Q, K) and 10s** count as zero.

If a hand's total goes over 9, you simply drop the first digit. 
*   **Example 1:** A 7 and an 8 equals 15. Drop the 1. The hand is worth **5**.
*   **Example 2:** A 9 and a King (0) equals **9**. (This is a "natural" and immediately wins).
*   **Example 3:** Two 6s equals 12. Drop the 1. The hand is worth **2**.

<ProTip title="THE INVISIBLE RULE ENGINE">
Unlike blackjack, you never say "hit" or "stand" in baccarat. If neither side is dealt an 8 or 9 (a "Natural"), a strict set of casino rules dictates whether the Player or Banker draws a third card. **You do not need to memorize these rules.** The dealer applies them automatically like a software engine. You just watch it happen.
</ProTip>

## The Bets (And The pitfall)

Baccarat is famous because the house edge on the two main bets is incredibly low. But casinos make up for it by offering a third option that is pure poison to your bankroll.

### 1. The Banker Bet
This is statistically the best bet in the game. Because of how the drawing rules work, the Banker hand wins slightly more often than the Player hand. Because of this advantage, the casino charges a 5% commission on Banker wins. Even with the tax, the house edge is a razor-thin **1.06%**.

### 2. The Player Bet
You win if the Player hand beats the Banker. It pays 1:1, with no commission taken. The house edge here is **1.24%**. It's slightly worse than Banker, but still better than almost everything else in the casino.

### 3. The Tie Bet 
You are betting that both hands end on the exact same total. It usually pays an enticing 8:1 (sometimes 9:1). 

<MythBuster myth="The Tie bet pays 8 to 1, making it a high-value sleeper bet if you catch a streak." reality="THE REALITY">
The Tie bet is one of the worst wagers on the floor. The house edge sits at a catastrophic **14.36%**. For context, that is worse than betting on a single number in double-zero roulette. If you want to burn cash, play the Tie. If you want to survive, stick to Player and Banker.

## Online Variations to Spot

If you fire up a live dealer table online, you might see slightly different rule variations. Here is what they actually mean for your wallet:

*   **No Commission Baccarat:** They drop the 5% tax on Banker wins. Sounds great, right? The catch: If the Banker wins with a specific total (usually a 6), the payout is slashed to 1:2 (you only win half your bet). 
*   **EZ Baccarat:** No commission on Banker wins, but if the Banker wins with a 3-card total of 7, your Banker bet "pushes" (you don't win or lose). 
*   **Side Bets (Dragon Bonus, Pairs):** Strictly entertainment. They carry massive house edges. 

## The Bottom Line

Baccarat feels calm and systematic, which makes it remarkably easy to play for three hours straight without realizing it. Because you aren't making stressful mid-hand decisions, the game moves fast.

**Your only real strategy is table selection and bankroll discipline.** Choose a table with standard payouts, flat-bet on Banker or Player, ignore the scorecards tracking past hands (which have zero impact on the next hand), and set a strict stop-loss before you start.
