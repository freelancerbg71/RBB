takeaways:
  - "The 'House Edge' is the mathematical tax you pay on every spin or hand. In Blackjack with good rules, it is the lowest tax in the casino."
  - "A casino paying '6:5 on Blackjack' instead of '3:2' is quietly stealing your money. It increases the house edge by almost 400%."
  - "The dealer isn't lucky; they just have a positional advantage. You have to act first, meaning you can bust before they ever show their cards."

Most casino games (like Slots or Roulette) are mathematically "solved" against you before you even sit down. There is exactly zero you can do to change the odds. 

Blackjack is different. The casino still has a mathematical advantage (the house edge), but the *size* of that advantage depends entirely on two things: the specific rules printed on the felt table in front of you, and your ability to stop making emotional decisions.

If you understand how the odds actually work, you can reduce the casino's house edge to less than 0.5%. If you play based on "gut feelings," that edge shoots up to 2% or 3%, and they will happily deplete your wallet. 

Here is what actually dictates your odds of winning.

## The Positional Advantage (Why the Dealer Always Has the Edge)

If you follow Basic Strategy perfectly, why does the casino still win in the long run?

Because you have to act first. In Blackjack, if you hit and bust (go over 21), you lose your money instantly. It doesn't matter if the dealer subsequently flips their cards and *also* busts. You already lost. 

This is the entire foundation of the casino's advantage. They force you to navigate the risk of busting first, and they sweep your chips before they even have to play their hand.

## The Three Rules That Dictate the Math

You cannot control the cards, but you can control which table you sit at. The rules printed on the green felt dictate exactly how fast you are expected to lose your money. 

<StepNode step="1" title="The 6:5 Payout Misconception">
Always look at the text printed in the middle of the table. If it says **"Blackjack pays 3 to 2"**, you are safe. If you bet $10 and hit a natural 21, you win $15. If it says **"Blackjack pays 6 to 5"**, get up and walk away. That $10 bet now only pays $12. That tiny payout change increases the casino's house edge from ~0.5% to almost **2.0%**. It is the biggest legal misconception in the pit.
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="2" title="Dealer Hits on Soft 17 (H17)">
Does the felt say "Dealer must stand on all 17s" (S17) or "Dealer hits Soft 17" (H17)? You want the dealer to stand. If they hit a Soft 17, it gives them a free chance to improve a mediocre hand, which adds about **0.2%** to the house edge. 
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="3" title="The Deck Count">
A single-deck game gives the player the best statistical odds. A game dealt out of an 8-deck "shoe" favors the casino. The math changes slightly depending on how many decks are in play, which is why your Basic Strategy chart must match the deck count.
</StepNode>

<MythBuster myth="If the dealer is showing a 6, they are definitely going to bust, so you should always stand." reality="THE MATH CHECK">
A dealer showing a 6 is in the worst possible position, yes. But they only bust exactly **42% of the time**. That means 58% of the time, the dealer is going to successfully make a hand of 17 through 21. If you stubbornly stand on a 12 against a 6, you still lose more than half the time. Basic strategy takes this into account. Play the math, not the myth.
</MythBuster>

## The Probability of Busting

If you refuse to memorize a Basic Strategy chart, you at least need to understand the mathematical reality of drawing cards. 

If you hold a Hard 12, and you ask for a hit, you have a **31% chance** of drawing a 10-value card and busting immediately. If you hold a Hard 16, that chance skyrockets to **62%**. 

This is why sitting on a 16 against a dealer's 10 is so agonizing. You are statistically likely to bust if you hit, but you are statistically *more* likely to lose if you stand (because the dealer has a 10 and is highly favored to reach 17-21). Basic Strategy tells you to hit, simply because it is the slightly *less terrible* mathematical option. 

<ProTip title="THE FREQUENCY OF BLACKJACK">
You will be dealt a natural Blackjack roughly **1 in every 21 hands** (about a 4.8% chance). You cannot sit at a table waiting for blackjacks to save you. You have to win the ugly hands - the 18s against a 17, the successful double-downs on 11 - to actually survive a session.
