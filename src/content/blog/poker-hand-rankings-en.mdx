takeaways:
  - "Poker is a game of exactly five cards. Not four, not six. The best five-card combination always wins."
  - "Suits do not break ties. If you both have a Flush with an Ace-high, you split the pot. Spades do not beat Hearts."
  - "Your 'Kicker' (your highest unpaired card) is the most important card in your hand when multiple people hit the same pair on the board."

There is nothing worse than shoving all your chips into the middle of the table, flipping over your cards with a smug look on your face, and having the dealer slowly slide the pot to the guy next to you because you misread the board.

If you don't instantly know what beats what without having to think about it, you have no business playing poker for real money. You are playing a strategy game without knowing how the pieces move. 

Here is the absolute hierarchy of poker hands, from the mythical to the miserable, and the tie-breaker rules that usually trip up beginners.

## The Hierarchy (Best to Worst)

Memorize this. Not loosely. Exactly.

<StepNode step="1" title="Royal Flush">
**A-K-Q-J-10 of the exact same suit.** This is just the highest possible Straight Flush. It is the rarest hand in poker. You will likely play for years and never see one.
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="2" title="Straight Flush">
**Five cards in sequential order, all the same suit** (e.g., 5-6-7-8-9 of Hearts). If two players have a Straight Flush, the one with the highest top card wins.
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="3" title="Four of a Kind (Quads)">
**Four cards of the exact same rank** (e.g., four 8s). If two players miraculously have Four of a Kind (because the board paired twice), the higher rank wins.
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="4" title="Full House (A Boat)">
**Three of a Kind AND a Pair in the same five-card hand** (e.g., three Jacks and two 4s). If two players have a Full House, the player with the higher Three of a Kind wins. The Pair only matters if the Three of a Kind is matched (which happens if it's on the community board).
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="5" title="Flush">
**Any five cards of the exact same suit**, not in sequential order. 
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="6" title="Straight">
**Five sequential cards of mixed suits** (e.g., 4-5-6-7-8 of different suits). The Ace can be used as the highest card (A-K-Q-J-10) or the lowest card (A-2-3-4-5, known as "The Wheel"), but it cannot wrap around (Q-K-A-2-3 is not a Straight).
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="7" title="Three of a Kind (Trips/Set)">
**Three cards of the same rank, and two unmatched random cards.** 
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="8" title="Two Pair">
**Two different pairs, plus one unmatched card.** If two players have Two Pair, the highest top pair wins. If they share the same top pair, the highest second pair wins.
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="9" title="One Pair">
**Two cards of the same rank, plus three unmatched cards.** This is the hand that actually wins the majority of pots in Texas Hold'em.
</StepNode>


## The Tie-Breakers That Cost You Money

If two players end up with the same type of hand, the rules for breaking the tie are ruthless and exact.

<MythBuster myth="In a Flush vs. Flush scenario, Spades beat Hearts." reality="THE RULE">
**Suits Have No Value.** In standard poker (Texas Hold'em, Omaha), all suits are equal. A Flush in Spades does not beat a Flush in Hearts. If two players have a Flush, the player holding the single highest card within that suit wins. If the highest card is on the board, you check the next highest card, and so on. If all five Flush cards on the board are higher than anyone's hole cards, the pot is universally split.
</MythBuster>

### The Kicker (Your Worst Enemy)
The most common scenario in poker is two players hitting the exact same pair. 

Let's say the board reads **K-8-4-2-9**. 
*   You hold **K-Q**.
*   Your opponent holds **K-J**.

You both have a Pair of Kings. Who wins? **You do, because of the Kicker.**

Poker is a 5-card game. 
Your final hand is: **K-K-Q-9-8**. 
Their final hand is: **K-K-J-9-8**.

Because your Queen is higher than their Jack, your 5-card hand is stronger. This is why playing weak starting hands like K-4 or A-3 is a massive trap. You will hit your pair, feel confident, and then lose your entire stack to someone who hit the same pair but has a better kicker.

<ProTip title="PLAYING THE BOARD">
In Texas Hold'em, you are trying to make the best 5-card hand out of seven available cards (your two hole cards + five community cards). If the board reads **A-K-Q-J-10** (a Broadway Straight), and you are holding a miserable pair of 2s, your 2s mean nothing. The board *is* the best 5-card hand. You simply "play the board" and split the pot with whoever is still in the hand.
