takeaways:
  - "Roulette is a static game of fixed probability. No betting system, no 'hot numbers', and no dealer spin technique can change the house edge."
  - "The number of green zeros on the wheel dictates your expected loss. Single-zero wheels cut the casino's advantage in half."
  - "Inside bets pay big but deplete your funds steadily. Outside bets keep your session alive but pad the casino's long-term margin."

Walk into any casino and the roulette tables are surrounded by people aggressively stacking chips, tracking "hot" and "cold" numbers on glowing digital boards, and waiting for the ball to drop with a superstitious intensity.

If you don't know the math, it feels like a game of momentum. 

It isn't. Roulette is a static mechanism of fixed probabilities. The wheel has no memory. The ball doesn't know where it landed last time. Your only real advantage is knowing exactly which table rules are quietly stacked against you before you buy in.

## The Roulette Primer (In 60 Seconds)

<StepNode step="1" title="The Layout">
The table is an ocean of numbers (0-36). You place chips on specific numbers, colors (red/black), or ranges (high/low, odd/even) to predict where the ball will land.
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="2" title="The Spin">
The dealer (or RNG software, if online) closes betting. The wheel spins in one direction, the ball is launched in the other.
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="3" title="The Payout">
If the ball lands on your number or feature, you get paid according to a strict, unchangeable paytable. Everything else is swept into the dealer's rack.

## The "Zero Tax" (Why Wheel Rules Matter Most)

Before you learn how to bet, you need to learn how not to get robbed by the wheel itself. The core of roulette is 36 numbers. A straight bet on a number pays 35:1. 

If the wheel *only* had 36 numbers, it would be a fair game. The casino makes its money by adding green "0" pockets. 

<ProTip title="THE DOUBLE-ZERO IMPACT">
**European Roulette** has a single zero (`0`). This gives the house an edge of roughly **2.70%**.\n\n**American Roulette** adds a second zero (`00`). This nearly doubles the house edge to **5.26%**, without increasing your payouts. If you sit at an American table when a European table is available, you are volunteering to lose money twice as fast. Always look for the single-zero wheel.
</ProTip>

There is a third variant called **French Roulette**, which is a single-zero wheel with a massive advantage attached. If you place an even-money bet (like Red or Black) and the ball lands on `0`, special rules like **La Partage** (you get half your bet back) or **En Prison** (your bet stays locked for the next spin) apply. This slashes the house edge down to a microscopic **1.35%**.

If you only remember one rule before dropping cash: count the zeros.

## The Bets: Inside vs. Outside

The layout is split into two zones. The math on your expected loss is identical across the board, but the variance (how wild your night feels) changes drastically based on where you put your chips.

### Outside Bets (The Grind)

These are the wide-net bets on the perimeter of the table. They hit frequently, but the payouts are low.

*   **Even-Money Bets (1:1 Payout):** Red/Black, Odd/Even, 1-18/19-36. 
*   **Columns & Dozens (2:1 Payout):** Betting on a full column of 12 numbers, or sections like the 1st 12.

**The Reality:** Outside bets are less stressful. You will win more often, but a bad streak will still slowly grind your bankroll down to zero because that green `0` is always lurking to wipe out the entire perimeter at once.

### Inside Bets (The Lottery)

These are the targeted strikes inside the number grid. They rarely hit, but they pay out massive multiples.

*   **Straight Up (35:1):** Betting on a single number. 
*   **Split (17:1):** Placing a chip on the line between two adjacent numbers.
*   **Street (11:1):** Betting a row of three numbers.
*   **Corner (8:1):** Betting the intersection of four numbers.
*   **Line (5:1):** Betting two adjacent rows (six numbers).

<MythBuster myth="The Basket (or 'Top Line') bet covering 0, 00, 1, 2, and 3 is a great safety net on an American wheel." reality="THE MATH CHECK">
The Basket bet carries the steepest mathematical disadvantage on the board. It pays 6:1, but the mathematical house edge spikes to a steep **7.89%**. This wager provides a significantly lower mathematical return over time. 
</MythBuster>

## The System Delusion

If you play long enough, someone will try to sell you a "foolproof" roulette system. Usually, it's a version of the **Martingale** (doubling your bet after every loss so that one win recovers everything).

Don't buy it. Table maximums and bankroll realities obliterate these systems in the long run. The math says that eventually, a long string of red will hit, your doubled bets will hit the table limit, and you will lose a catastrophic amount of money trying to chase a $10 profit.

## Online Survival Tactics

*   **Live Dealer vs. RNG:** Live dealer games use physical wheels and take 45-60 seconds per spin. RNG (Animated) games are instant. RNG roulette operates at a much higher frequency. Fast-paced features like 'Turbo Mode' increase your exposure to the house edge significantly over standard timeframes.
*   **Find the Hidden French Wheel:** Online casinos often bury their French Roulette games (because the odds favor you too much). Search the lobby actively.
*   **Use Limits:** Decide your stop-loss before you deposit. 

If the wheel starts feeling like a blur and the bets are entirely automatic, walk away. Roulette is designed to be mesmerizing; your defense is knowing when the math has beaten you for the night.
