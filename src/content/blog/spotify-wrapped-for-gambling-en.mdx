description: "Understanding why 'Year in Review' summaries focus on 'Biggest Wins' rather than net outcomes, and how to read them objectively."

takeaways:
  - "When a casino shows you a 'Highlight Reel' of your past year, they are deliberately selecting metrics that trigger dopamine while hiding the metrics that trigger regret."
  - "Being told you hit an 'Epic 12-Day Streak' is designed to make you feel like a skilled player on a mission, completely ignoring how much those 12 days actually cost you."
  - "The only metric that matters is Net Profit/Loss. If the recap doesn't show it plainly in big letters, the recap is just an ad for you to deposit more."

At the end of every year, Spotify famously gives users a beautiful, highly shareable graphic showing them their most-played songs and favorite artists. It's fun, social, and harmless.

Recently, online casinos and sportsbooks realized they could adopt this exact UI. Now, players regularly receive flashy, confetti-filled emails titled **"Your Year in Review!"** or **"Your Casino Wrapped!"**

These recaps serve as targeted marketing tools, specifically structured to highlight exciting moments while minimizing the focus on overall deposits. 

## The Highlight Reel Perspective

Human memory is incredibly flawed when it comes to gambling. We naturally remember the thrilling wins and conveniently suppress the memory of the long, depressing losing streaks. Marketing teams understand this dynamic, and these summaries are structured to emphasize those thrilling peaks.

<StepNode step="1" title="The Loud Metrics">
The recap will aggressively highlight your "Biggest Single Win", your "Most Played Game", and your "Longest Hot Streak". These numbers are emotionally loud. They remind you of the specific nights where you felt invincible, reinforcing the fantasy that you are a successful player.
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="2" title="The Silent Metrics">
The recap will completely omit the only number that actually matters to your bank account: Your **Total Net Loss**. It will also hide your 'Total Amount Deposited' versus your 'Total Amount Withdrawn'. 
</StepNode>

Focusing solely on these highlights can easily skew your perception of your long-term mathematical outcomes. 

## Translating the Marketing Speak

When reviewing these summaries, it helps to translate the marketing terminology into objective metrics:

<MythBuster myth="'Congratulations! Your Longest Streak was 14 Days! You are Top 5% of all players in dedication!'" reality="THE TRANSLATION">
"This metric highlights extended periods of continuous play. From an educational standpoint, recognizing this pattern is key to implementing healthy breaks and maintaining proper session boundaries."
</MythBuster>

## How to Track Your Own Reality

For a truly accurate picture of your performance, maintaining a personal ledger is much more effective than relying on marketing summaries. 

<ProTip title="THE BORING CHECKLIST" icon=">">
Open a completely plain Notes app on your phone. Before you play, write down your starting balance and your hard stop limit. When you finish, write down the ending balance. Over the course of a year, ignore the "Biggest Win" emails and instead look at your own Notes app. Add up the total net loss. While it requires discipline, maintaining this personal record is the most effective way to understand your true return to player and make informed decisions.
