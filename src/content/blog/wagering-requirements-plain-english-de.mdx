takeaways:
  - "Wagering requirements (playthrough) act as a lock on your deposit. You cannot withdraw a single cent until you bet thousands of dollars."
  - "The headline multiplier (e.g., '30x') is deceptive. You must check if it applies to just the Bonus, or the Deposit + Bonus."
  - "Game weightings and max-bet limits exist to ensure you grind out your requirement on high-variance slots rather than low-edge table games."

You see a banner ad flashing: **"Deposit $100, Get $100 FREE!"** 

You deposit your money, play a few hands of Blackjack, win $50, and hit the withdraw button. A message pops up saying your withdrawal is denied because you haven't met the "playthrough requirements." You check the terms, and realize you are legally required to place $6,000 worth of bets before you can pull your original $100 out of your account.

Welcome to the reality of casino bonuses. 

A bonus is not a gift. It is a contractual agreement designed to keep your money inside the casino dashboard until the mathematical house edge grinds your balance to zero. Here is how to translate the fine print.

## What "30x Wagering" Actually Means

A wagering requirement (also called 'playthrough' or 'rollover') dictates exactly how much collective money you must pass through the casino's machines before your cash is "unlocked." 

But the multiplier isn't the catch. The catch is *what* the multiplier applies to. 

<StepNode step="1" title="The 'Bonus Only' Setup">
You deposit $100 and get a $100 bonus, with a 30x requirement on the **Bonus amount**. 
You must place $3,000 in bets ($100 x 30). This is somewhat standard.
</StepNode>

<StepNode step="2" title="The 'Deposit + Bonus' Structure">
You deposit $100 and get a $100 bonus, with a 30x requirement on the **Deposit AND Bonus**. 
You now must place **$6,000** in bets ($200 x 30). This essentially turns a 30x requirement into a 60x requirement.
</StepNode>

<MythBuster myth="I'll just claim the bonus and play safe bets on Roulette until I clear the 30x requirement." reality="THE GAME WEIGHTING REALITY">
Casinos aren't stupid. Read the "Game Contributions" section of the Terms and Conditions. Slots usually contribute 100% to your wagering requirement. However, low-house-edge table games like Blackjack and Roulette usually contribute 10% or even 0%. If Roulette contributes 10%, a $10 spin only clears $1 of your requirement. It is mathematically nearly impossible to clear a bonus on table games.

## The "Max Bet" Handcuffs

You realize you have to wager $6,000 to unlock your funds. You decide to just do twelve $500 spins on a slot machine to get it over with quickly. 

If you do this, the casino will confiscate your entire balance.

Buried in the Terms and Conditions of almost every bonus is a "Max Bet" clause. It usually dictates that while a bonus is active, you cannot place a single bet larger than $5.00. 

This forces you to sit there and execute 1,200 individual spins, giving the slot machine's RTP (Return to Player) massive amounts of time to deplete your balance over time. 

## The Win Cap

Some casinos go a step further. They will give you the bonus, attach a massive wagering requirement, and *then* stipulate a "Maximum Cashout" rule. 

This means even if you manage to hit a $5,000 jackpot while grinding through your $5 wager limits, you might hit a clause that says "Maximum withdrawal from bonus funds is capped at $500." The casino simply deletes the other $4,500 from your account when you try to cash out.

<ProTip title="THE ULTIMATE STRATEGY" icon="🛑">
For 90% of players, the smartest move regarding casino bonuses is to gently click the 'Opt Out' button. Playing with raw cash (no bonus attached) means you can play whatever game you want, at whatever stake size you want, and withdraw your winnings exactly ten seconds after hitting a jackpot. Peace of mind is usually worth more than the appeal of matched funds.
</ProTip>

If you insist on taking a bonus, never accept anything with a rollover higher than 35x on the *bonus amount only*, and immediately check if there is a win cap. If there is, close the tab and find a better operator.
