        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Scope</h2>
        <p>Read Between Bets ("we," "our," or "us") is an informational website. This Privacy Policy explains what data is (and is not) collected when you visit our site.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Information you provide</h3>
        <p>We do not offer account creation, a newsletter sign-up, or an on-site contact form. If you contact us by email, we will receive the information you include in your message (such as your email address and any content you send).</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Information collected automatically</h3>
        <p>Like most websites, our hosting provider and security systems may automatically log basic technical information when you access the site (for example: IP address, browser type, pages requested, and timestamps). This is typically used for security, abuse prevention, and reliability.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Cookies and Analytics</h2>
        <p>We may use basic analytics tools (such as privacy-focused analytics services) to understand how visitors use our site. This helps us improve content and user experience. We do not use cookies for advertising or behavioral tracking across other websites. Third-party sites you visit from our links may use cookies or similar technologies under their own policies.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Affiliate Links and Third Parties</h2>
        <p>Some links on this site are affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link, then register and make a deposit on a third-party casino site, we may earn a commission. Third-party websites and services are responsible for their own privacy practices.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may disclose information if required to comply with a legal obligation, protect our rights, or prevent abuse or fraud.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the limited information we may handle (such as email correspondence). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Age Restriction</h2>
        <p>This website is intended only for adults (18+ or the legal gambling age in your jurisdiction). We do not accept submissions from minors. If we become aware that a minor sent personal information, we delete it.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete personal information we hold about you. If you contacted us by email and want us to delete that correspondence, contact us using the email below.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Changes to This Policy</h2>
