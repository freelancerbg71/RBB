\# 📋 Pre-Publish Compliance Checklist — Gambling Affiliate Content



Use this checklist before publishing \*any\* article that contains affiliate links related to casino or iGaming content. Check off each item below to reduce regulatory, search engine, and compliance risk.



---



\## 🚫 Positioning \& Tone



✅ Content is \*\*educational and informational first\*\*, not promotional.  

✅ Avoid language that suggests gambling is a way to \*make money, get rich, or solve financial problems\*.  

✅ Do \*not\* include phrases like “best in X country”, “top bonuses”, “most profitable”.  

✅ No guarantee of outcomes or winnings.



---



\## ⚖️ Disclaimers \& Transparency



✅ A clear \*\*affiliate disclosure\*\* is present on the page before or near the first affiliate link.  

> e.g.: “This post contains affiliate links. We may earn commissions if you click and deposit.” :contentReference\[oaicite:1]{index=1}  



✅ The disclosure is \*\*visible at the top\*\* (not only in footers). :contentReference\[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

✅ A general \*\*responsible gambling message\*\* is included (e.g., “Gambling involves risk; play responsibly”). :contentReference\[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

✅ A general \*\*site disclaimer\*\* (non-operator message) is present (footer or site bar).



---



\## 🧒 Audience \& Targeting Safety



✅ No content is written in a way that \*appeals to minors\*.  

✅ No references to specific age groups or underage audiences.  

✅ Content does not include imagery or language attractive to minors.



---



\## 🧭 Jurisdiction / Localization



✅ The article does \*\*not\*\* claim legality or availability in specific countries or states.  

✅ No phrases like “legal in France”, “UK players”, “US residents”, etc.  

> Stick to general language: \*availability varies by location\*. :contentReference\[oaicite:4]{index=4}  



---



\## 🧠 SEO / Search Engine Safety



✅ The title and meta description are \*\*neutral and informational\*\*, not promotional.  

✅ Page uses clear headers (H1/H2s) and structured content to emphasize \*\*trust and accuracy\*\*.  

✅ E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) principles are followed — include facts, sources, and transparent structure. :contentReference\[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

✅ Website includes a visible \*\*about / contact\*\* section to support trust signals.

\## 📎 Affiliate Link Best Practices



✅ Do not insert affiliate links or "Where to play" blocks directly in the markdown body. The site layout automatically provides a "Where to Play" sidebar with our standard operators (Private Club Casino and BarbossaBet) next to guides.



✅ When referencing operators, treat them neutrally. Do not call operators "Safe" or "The Best", stick to facts.



✅ Mention friction points (like heavy wagering requirements or specific fees) when relevant to prove neutrality.



---



## 🎨 UX & Engagement



✅ The article includes at least one key hero image or inline explanatory diagram to break up text walls.



✅ Custom components (like `ClipboardNote` or styled tables) are used to format key tips and warnings, avoiding plain bullet points.



---



\## 📊 Responsible Content Quality



✅ Every factual claim is accurate and not speculative.  

✅ Content has value beyond affiliate links (e.g., genuine explanation of how the game works).  

✅ The page adds \*\*user value first\*\*, affiliate monetization second. :contentReference\[oaicite:7]{index=7}  



---



\## 🔄 Ongoing Maintenance



✅ Review this content every \*\*6–12 months\*\* for:

&nbsp;  - Regulatory language updates

&nbsp;  - Affiliate program changes

&nbsp;  - Outdated links



---



\## 🧾 Final Approval



Before publishing, confirm:



☑️ A trusted reviewer has read the article.  

☑️ Compliance flagging tools (if available) show no violations.  

☑️ Affiliate disclosure and responsible gambling messaging are prominent.
